title: Trade-offs
description: A guide to trade-offs in software development.
---

To fullfill its goals and be maintainable in a sustinable way, this project comes with a set of trade-offs. Here are some of them:

## Main template code

### Architecture



### Third-party libraries

The goal of the demo is to be used as a template for other projects.
For that reason, it uses a limited list of third-party libraries and tools.

It implies a quite limited datepicker for example, as a great opportunity to showcase the ones provided by UI frameworks like Angular Material or PrimeNG.


## Paid solutions

At the time of writing, this project is not sponsored.
For that reason, it prevents solutions requiring some sort of payment to be showcased. While not limited, It includes solutions requiring:
- a subscription
- a one-time payment (like a license)
- on-usage payment (like a pay-per-use API)
