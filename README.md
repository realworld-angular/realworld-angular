# RealWorld Angular

RealWorld Angular is a collection of example applications built using Angular, one of the most popular front-end frameworks. The project is designed to showcase various Angular libraries and demonstrate technical aspects and best practices in Angular development. By offering real-world scenarios and complex app structures, RealWorld Angular aims to bridge the gap between simplistic tutorial projects and the challenges developers face in real-world applications.
